# daobase

daobase provides a very lightweight and easy to use DAO based on postgreSQL. 

It encapsulates transactions and allows basic CRUD operations. Native SQL is accessible for other use cases. External logging frameworks are easily hookable and daobase provides extensive tracing output for error analysis.

## get started

Have a look at the test case to understand how to use daobase.
For your own application, just inherit from the provided class and build your functionality on top. It's as simple as that!

## notes

Currently still under heavy development.
